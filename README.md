So, you got to my GitHub profile.



My name is **szyxiii** (*[es][zed][wai]*), I'm 19 y.o. and I'm from Russia.

I'm a developer, designer, beginner artist, **genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist**.
I've been a developer for more than 6 years now and completed many projects, almost none of them are in my GitHub repos, as they are private and customers paid for it actually.

Pretty confident with **Python** (+ **Django**), **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **Pawn**, **C#** (including **WPF**, **WPF** is perfect), **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap 4**.

And some good experience with **C**, **C++**, **Dart**, **Node.js**, **Java**, **JPHP** and **Lua**.

Learning **Golang** now because of [Southclaws](https://github.com/Southclaws) (Southclaws I love you)
