So, you got to my GitHub profile.



I'm **szyxiii** (*[es][zed][wai]*), I'm 19 y.o. and I'm from Russia.

I'm a developer, designer and just a good person. I've been a developer for more than 5 years now and completed many projects. Almost none of them are in my GitHub repos, as they are private.

---
Pretty confident with **Python** (+ **Django**), **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **Pawn**, **C#** (including **WPF**, **WPF** is perfect), **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap 4**.

And some good experience with **C**, **C++**, **Dart**, **Node.js** and **Lua**.

Learning **Golang** now because of [Southclaws](https://github.com/Southclaws) (Southclaws I love you)
